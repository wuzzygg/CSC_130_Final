# Data Structures & Algorithm Analysis
## California State University, Sacramento

Welcome to my GitHub repository for "Data Structures & Algorithm Analysis," a course I am taking at California State University, Sacramento, under the instruction of Professor Matthew Phillips.

### Project Description
Throughout this course, we'll engage in a series of progressive checkpoints. These checkpoints are strategically designed to build our understanding and skills in data structures and algorithm analysis. Each checkpoint is an essential step toward the final project, which will serve as a comprehensive demonstration of the knowledge and abilities acquired. The final project is expected to be a culmination of the concepts and techniques practiced in these checkpoints.
